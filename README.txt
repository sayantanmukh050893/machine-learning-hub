In the following project we are mainly predicting whether an individual is Diabetic or not based on many independent features.

The category 0 means that the individual is not diabetic in nature while 1 means that the individual is diabetic in nature.

Let the Null Hypothesis is that the individual is diabetic in nature so the alternate Hypothesis is that the individual is not diabetic
in nature.

Type I error or false positive occurs when the Null Hypothesis is correct but due to wrong analysis of the model, we reject it.
i.e. The individual is diabetic but the model predicted it to be not.

Type II error or false negative occurs when the Null Hypothesis is wrong but due to wrong analysis of the model, we fail to reject it.
i.e. The individual is not diabetic but the model predicted it to be.

In this scenario, missing a potential diabetic patient is very dangerous than prescribing medicine for diabetes to a healthy
patient.

But prescribing diabetes medicine to a healthy person can be very detrimental.

So the f1 score should also be taken into consideration.

Along with the accuracy of the model we should also consider precision and f1 score.
